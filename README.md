# Python packages

Projects in Python can become really big... It is then a good practice to [structure the repository using packages](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/#structure-of-the-repository).

This is a sample project in Python that uses the packages structure. Different functions are collected into different folders. All the magic here depends on the presence of the `__init__.py` files in each folder.
